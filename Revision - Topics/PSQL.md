**SQL Basics & Syntax**
- What is SQL
- SQL vs RDBMS
- SQL vs NoSQL
- SQL vs PostgreSQL
- Basic SQL syntax (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT)
- Filtering data: WHERE with operators (=, <>, <, >, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE)
- Sorting data: ORDER BY (ASC/DESC)
- Basic SQL commands: CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE
- Char vs Varchar
- VARCHAR vs TEXT

***

**Keys & Constraints**
- Primary key, Unique key
- Candidate key, Alternate key
- Foreign key, foreign key creation
- Composite key
- Natural key
- Default
- Constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, EXCLUSION)
- CHECK constraint
- Can unique key contain null value?
- Which datatypes can be used as a primary key?

***

**Indexes & Performance**
- Index, Indexing types, Types of indexes (Clustered, Non-clustered, Hash)
- Composite index
- Hash index
- Create index
- Performance improvement in SQL
- How indexing works (internally)
- Drawbacks of indexing
- Listing indexes

***

**Relationships & Database Design**
- Entities
- Relationships, Relationship concepts & implementations, Types of relationships (1:1, M:N, etc.)
- ER diagram
- 3-schema architecture (internal, conceptual, external)
- Table inheritance vs Foreign key
- Create table with foreign key
- Join, Join and its implementation, Join syntax
- Self join vs Cross join
- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN
- JOIN vs UNION
- Subqueries (Types & Practical Use)
- Union, Union all, Intersect, Minus

***

**Normalization & Denormalization**
- Normalization, Denormalization
- Normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
- Partial and transitive dependencies
- Disadvantages of normalization

***

**Transactions & ACID**
- Transactions: Rollback, Commit, Isolation, Durability
- ACID Properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- Deadlock
- Savepoint
- Multi-version concurrency control

***

**Data Manipulation & Practice**
- Insert, Update, Delete, Truncate, Drop table
- Update vs Alter, Delete vs Truncate vs Drop
- Scalar and Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, etc.)
- DDL, DML, DCL, TCL commands (and differences)
- Group by, Having, Order of execution
- Case, If condition in select query
- Nested queries, Subquery workouts
- Offset, Limit, Distinct, Wildcards, Like, ILIKE, Regex, BETWEEN, IN, ANY, ALL, EXISTS
- Copy table, Materialized view

***

**Views, Triggers, Stored Procedures & Functions**
- View (creation, updating, usage, pros and cons)
- Materialized view
- Triggers (types, usage, creation, drawbacks)
- Stored procedure, Stored procedure vs Function
- Cursor
- Scalar functions
- Window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, etc.)
- Closures in SQL

***

**Advanced & PostgreSQL**
- PostgreSQL vs MySQL
- Features of PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin
- BLOBs
- Array datatype
- Storing JSON, JSON fields
- Backup and restore, pg_dump
- Sharding, Partitioning
- Partitioning types
- Auto increment, Serial vs Bigserial
- Group concat
- Data redundancy
- Data integrity and improvement
- Scaling (vertical, horizontal)
- Query optimization, Explain, Analyze command

***

**Practice Queries & Problem-Solving**
- Find customers who spent more than the average, total spending of all customers
- Find the second highest salary
- Find the third largest number
- Group by average/aggregated data, count
- Employees with more than 6 months experience
- Car with second highest price, Cars above average price
- Student not in specific department
- Employees who have same salary
- Find min, max, filter by subqueries
- Practice: create your own queries, complex queries, join queries, etc.
- Update with join, remove duplicates, increase salary by condition
- Create users, roles, and grant access

***

**Security & Best Practices**
- SQL Injection and prevention
- Problems in scalability
- Data integrity
- Practice good conventions when writing SQL queries
- How to secure SQL database

***

**Pending & Feedback**
- Needs more practice with update queries, joins, subqueries, index creation
- Clarify topics such as indexing, views, normalization, constraints
