**2. CRUD Operations & Queries**

- CRUD
- Update operators ($set, $unset, $inc, etc.)
- Find conditions
- Skip, limit, sort
- Count, countDocuments
- Aggregation pipeline
- Aggregation stages
- Aggregation operators (
    $lookup,
    $unwind,
    $match,
    $group,
    $max,
    $min,
    $project,
    $sort,
    $facet,
    $out,
    $addToSet,
    $push,
    $elemMatch,
    $in,
    $nin,
    $regex,
    $bitsAnySet,
    $size,
    $expr
  )
- Single Purpose Aggregation
- Accumulator operators (sum, avg, etc.)
- Operations using $cond
- Projection field selection (name: 1, place: 0 in $project)
- Remove key from document
- Rename collection
- Rename field
- Find in array
- Query in arrays
- Array function
- Comparison operator
- Logical operator
- Upsert
- Upsert vs save
- Save vs insert
- $addToSet vs $push
- Pull vs pop
- Out vs merge
- RegexMatch
