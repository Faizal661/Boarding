A Schemaless Database (often used interchangeably with NoSQL or Non-Relational databases) 
is a system that does not require a fixed, predefined table structure or "schema" before you insert data.

Unlike SQL databases where you must define every column and data type upfront, 
a schemaless DB allows you to store data in flexible formats like JSON documents, key-value pairs, or graphs.
